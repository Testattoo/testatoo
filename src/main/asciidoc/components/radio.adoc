=== Radio

image::components/Radio.png[Radio]

"a *radio button* allows the user to choose only one of a predefined set of options. Radio buttons are
arranged in groups of two or more and displayed on screen as, for example, a list of circular holes that can contain
white space (for unselected) or a dot (for selected). Each radio button is normally accompanied by a label describing
the choice that the radio button represents.
The choices are mutually exclusive; when the user selects a radio button, any previously selected radio button in the
same group becomes deselected (making it so only one can be selected)."

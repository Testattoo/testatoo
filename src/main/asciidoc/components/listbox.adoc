"a *listBox* allows the user to select one or more items from a list contained within a static, multiple line
text box. The user clicks inside the box on an item to select it, sometimes in combination with the ⇧ Shift or Ctrl
in order to make multiple selections. "Control-clicking" an item that has already been selected, unselects it."
